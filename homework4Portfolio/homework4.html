        <p>
          I am currently a senior from Elon University who plans to graduate in May 2020.
          I am obtaining a BS in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics. I am a proficient
          coder who is open to learning new things and team focused. Most recently I worked as
          an application developer for MetLife in a summer internship. Through this I obtained corporate
          exprience, learned a variety of new things, and learned how to work on a team. During my time a team
          of interns including me won the intern innovation challenge and currently MetLife is implimenting our idea
          of Environdental into the company. I am currently looking to work on team that will present me with new challenges.
          Some of my interests include Space and the further explanation, going to see movies, and spending time at amusment
          parks.
