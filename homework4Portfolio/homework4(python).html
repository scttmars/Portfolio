      <p>
        This project was designed to take in a file of words to play hangman. The code is designed to cheat in the game and keep track of how many words are still possible based on what letters the user has suggested. This makes it very hard for the user to beat the program.

      <p>
        For this project I connected to a database and used SQL to extract mentions, hashtags, and urls from tweets. Once this data was obtained it was put into a database.

        This is a set of example problems of me using list comprehensions in python. This also included practice using regex.
